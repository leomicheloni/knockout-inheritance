# Knockout Inheritance approache.

A test approach for implementing inheritance in knockout.
This is a little sample app using  ````ko.utils.extend```` for extending a viewmodel functionality.

## How to run
You need to have Nodejs. Type ````npm install```` to install dependencies, then you can build the project using ````npm run build````, just open index.html to see how it works.

##Continuos build
If you don't want to type ````npm run build```` every time you make a change you can type ````npm run watch```` for continuos building and refresh the page manually.

Enjoy.
